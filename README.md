# Usage Instructions

Milestone_5.py contains the full code required the run the Hangman game, alongside docstrings documenting the purpose of each function.  The list word_list can be ammended to provide an infinitely long list of words. The code will randomly select one of these with which to play the game.
Once word_list has been provided and the programme ran, the player is asked to iteratively guess letters in the selected word. Each time they are informed if this was correct or not. If incorrect the player loses a life. The game continues until either the player guesses all the characters in the word, or runs out of lives.
